# XGBoost Feature Importance Analysis

This directory contains tools and analysis for understanding the most important predictors in the XGBoost model for predicting insufficient pain management in prehospital trauma care.

## Files Created

### üìä Analysis Scripts
- **`feature_importance_analysis.py`**: Comprehensive Python script that generates a detailed 4-panel figure showing XGBoost feature importance analysis
- **`xgboost_feature_importance.ipynb`**: Interactive Jupyter notebook for exploring feature importance with step-by-step analysis

### üìà Generated Outputs
- **`xgboost_feature_importance.png`**: High-resolution comprehensive figure with 4 panels:
  1. Top 15 most important predictors (bar chart)
  2. Feature importance by clinical category
  3. Cumulative importance curve
  4. Model performance summary

## Key Findings

### üéØ Top 10 Most Important Predictors
1. **VAS Pain Score at Scene (0.575)** - Dominant predictor accounting for >50% of importance
2. **Glasgow Coma Scale (7 min) (0.050)** - Neurological assessment over time
3. **Departure Location (0.046)** - Transport/scene factors
4. **Patient Positioning (0.042)** - Clinical intervention
5. **Oxygen Saturation (0.036)** - Vital signs
6. **Glasgow Coma Scale (0.033)** - Initial neurological status
7. **Heart Rate (5 min) (0.033)** - Vital signs over time
8. **Heart Rate (0.030)** - Initial vital signs
9. **Consciousness Level (0.028)** - Clinical assessment
10. **Oxygen Saturation (11 min) (0.028)** - Vital signs over time

### üè• Clinical Categories by Importance
- **Pain Assessment**: 0.575 (57.5% of total importance)
- **Vital Signs**: 0.186 (18.6% of total importance)
- **Neurological**: 0.111 (11.1% of total importance)
- **Scene/Transport**: 0.088 (8.8% of total importance)
- **Demographics**: 0.028 (2.8% of total importance)
- **Medical Interventions**: 0.011 (1.1% of total importance)

### üìä Cumulative Importance Milestones
- **1 feature** captures 50% of importance (VAS at scene)
- **7 features** capture 80% of importance
- **10 features** capture 90% of importance

## Clinical Implications

### ‚ö° Key Insights
1. **Initial pain assessment** is by far the most important predictor
2. **Neurological status** (GCS, consciousness) is highly significant
3. **Vital signs patterns** over time provide valuable information
4. **Scene/transport factors** contribute meaningful predictive power
5. Model is **clinically interpretable** and based on established assessment tools

### üéØ Clinical Recommendations
- **Focus on accurate VAS assessment** at scene - this is the single most important factor
- **Perform thorough neurological evaluation** including GCS scoring
- **Monitor vital signs longitudinally** during transport
- **Document scene factors** and patient positioning accurately
- **Use standardized assessment protocols** to ensure data quality

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 80.6%
- **ROC-AUC**: 78.1%
- **Training samples**: 9,815
- **Test samples**: 2,454
- **Features**: 26 prehospital variables

## Usage

### Running the Analysis
```bash
# Generate comprehensive figure
python feature_importance_analysis.py

# Interactive exploration
jupyter notebook xgboost_feature_importance.ipynb
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- XGBoost 3.0.5+
- matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Custom modules: data_preprocessing, ml_models

## Data Leakage Prevention
‚úÖ **All features are prehospital variables** available during EMS contact  
‚úÖ **No hospital arrival or outcome data** included  
‚úÖ **VAS_on_arrival and derived features excluded** to prevent leakage  
‚úÖ **Model suitable for real-time prediction** during transport  

## Research Context
This analysis supports research into prehospital pain management prediction, enabling:
- Early identification of patients at risk for inadequate pain management
- Evidence-based clinical decision support
- Quality improvement in EMS pain management protocols
- Proactive intervention strategies
